## About The Project

Lucid is an open source web proxy and unblocker project hosted on GitHub that is designed to help users bypass online censorship and access blocked websites. The project is built using a powerful UltraViolet and Dynamic Interception Proxy Backend, which allows it to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses in real-time, ensuring fast and reliable access to blocked content.

One of the key features of Lucid is its ability to dynamically adapt to changing network conditions and blocking techniques, which makes it an effective tool for circumventing even the most advanced censorship systems. Additionally, Lucid is designed to be highly customizable and flexible, allowing users to fine-tune its behavior to their specific needs and requirements.

Lucid is released under an open source license, which means that anyone can access its source code, modify it, and distribute it freely. This makes Lucid a collaborative and community-driven project, with contributions from developers and users all over the world.

Overall, Lucid is a powerful and innovative web proxy and unblocker that combines cutting-edge technology with an open and collaborative development approach. Whether you're looking to bypass censorship in your country, access geo-restricted content, or simply protect your online privacy, Lucid is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a fast, reliable, and customizable web proxy solution.
